The interface is relatively simple.  You pick  an item (a slogan, for example), a question ("rate how much you like this slogan"), and then upload a .csv file with a list of all the possible slogans you want to test out.  You can choose anywhere between 10-20 ratings for each, which we've found to give a pretty consistant response.

We tried out this technique with several slogan ideas we were considering.  But before I show you the response, try guessing the order that people preferred the following list:
<ul>
	<li>"Eyes Save Lives"</li>
	<li>"Charity Done Right"</li>
	<li>"Donate Without Paying"</li>
	<li>"We Give You Superpowers"</li>
	<li>"Help Things You Care About"</li>
	<li>"Join the Mission, Save the World"</li>
</ul>
Our first test included 15 titles, each which had 10 votes.  At $0.02 per vote, that's $3.00 (plus a bit extra for using Turk), which is ridiculously cheap for market research.

When all the votes come in, you can see an analysis that looks like this:
